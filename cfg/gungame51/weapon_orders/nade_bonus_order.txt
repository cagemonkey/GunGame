//    =========================================================================
//              
//           This is a normal weapon order file except it contains
//      information and examples for use with gg_nade_bonus.  Using a 
//      weapon order with gg_nade_bonus allows players to change weapons 
//      as they receive kills, yet they will remain on nade level.  Think of
//      it as a GunGame inside of nade level.  We will use this weapon order
//        as an example.
//
//           A player gets to nade level and is given a glock.  The player's
//      nade kills nobody, but they did manage to kill 2 other players with
//      the glock before being killed.  Once the player respawns they will
//      have a usp with their nade.  If gg_turbo is loaded, grenade bonus
//      level ups will preform just like a normal turbo levelup.
//
//            (Check the config file for options and settings.)
//
//           You can still use the multikill format just like any other
//      weapon file. (See default_weapon_order.txt for information on 
//      weapon orders.)
