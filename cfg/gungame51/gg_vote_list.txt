//     >> Information:
//    =========================================================================
//        You can use this file, or another of this format, to filter 
//    maps for map voting (gg_map_vote) based on player count.  You can 
//    specify a minimum and maximum amount of players that must be currently
//    logged in on the server for the map will display in the vote list.
//
//    Format: <map name>  [minimum players]  [maximum players]
//
//     >> Example:
//    =========================================================================
//        For bigger maps such as knas_speedcastle_css or de_dust2 you might 
//        not want to include that map in your rotation unless there were at 
//        least 10 players on the server.  However, you may always want to
//        include shotty, since its a relatively small map.
//        
//        So you would add:
//            
//            knas_speedcastle_css 10
//            de_dust2 10
//            aim_shotty
//        
//        If you wanted aim_shotty to only be in the vote when there are
//          between 0 and 10 players:
//
//            aim_shotty 0 10
//
//           
//    >> FAQ:
//   ==========================================================================
//        * It is not necessary to include a minimum or maximum player filter
//          for every map. If the number is blank, 0 is assumed and the map
//          will always be available.
//          
//        * You CANNOT get this functionality from "maplist.txt" or 
//          "mapcycle.txt"! You must copy that list into this file.
//          
//        * You will see errors from GunGame if none of the maps meet
//          the player requirements. Its recommended to leave several 
//          maps without a filter for this reason. 
//
